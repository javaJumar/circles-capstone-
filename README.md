Out & About 
===========
An application designed to help people be 'out and about', possibly keep faces away from a screen, and find fun events in their local community.

Motivation
----------
The idea for the app dawned on me when I personally needed to search for events locally so my wife and I can find new and fun things to do.

About:
------
Type in any interest, and put in your zip code. The app will search for all related events within a 30 mile radius. Click on the Google Maps markers for more information related to that event. The app is designed to be very intuitive. 

IMPORTANT: In the mobile view, click on a marker to view detials of the event. Clicking a marker will give you an option of searching again for an event, or go back to the map section.

Features
--------
In a screen dominated world where most of our interactions happen on a computer or a smart phone, this app was inspired with a purpose of helping people get out and enjoy local events and hopefully build relationships!
